<h1>Challenges in ERP Development: A Personal Perspective</h1>
<p>Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) applications have been pivotal in shaping the socio-economics of the software industry. Major players in the ERP domain include Microsoft, SAP, Deltek, Sage, and Oracle.</p>
<p>My first encounter with ERP was through a Hospital Management System, colloquially known as HMS. Constructing an ERP isn't technically challenging for a competent engineer who comprehends the underlying technology stack. The true challenge lies in integrating functionality and accommodating changes over time. Timelines are crucial since the vendor is committed to the product delivery, and user involvement also plays a significant role.</p>
<h2>Key Challenges Encountered in ERP Development</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Requirements:</strong> They are the linchpin in the development of any application. Assumptions can lead down a disastrous path. While it's beneficial to anticipate unknown aspects, avoid presuming everything that can be learned through customer interaction. Empathizing with the customer and understanding their perspective can significantly ease product delivery.</li>
    <li><strong>Technical Debt:</strong> A notorious term in the software world, technical debt can eat up 50% of revenue. While it's impossible to completely eliminate, it can be significantly reduced by implementing coding standards and problem-solving guidelines, especially for newcomers. If freshers are not provided with a structured approach to problem-solving, it leads to inefficient solutions that increase overall development time and costs.</li>
    <li><strong>Client Convincing:</strong> Clients often harbor expectations detached from reality. Therefore, software developers or business analysts must shoulder the responsibility of understanding client requirements and translating them into software solutions. Moreover, internal politics among client members can sometimes complicate functionality implementation. This is less of an issue in large corporations but frequently surfaces in smaller startups.</li>
    <li><strong>Managing Production Issues:</strong> As a developer, I found this task particularly challenging. Although QA teams strive to identify all issues before production, ERPs are critical for maintaining smooth enterprise operations. When issues arise, clients demand immediate solutions. This experience honed my debugging skills, enabling me to quickly identify whether the issue originated from the front end, back end, or the database. This is a greatly underrated skill that has allowed me to debug virtually any stack developed on TypeScript and JavaScript.</li>
    <li><strong>Concurrency Issue:</strong> ERP applications may not have as vast a user base as web user applications, but they demand superior redundancy and security because of the critical nature of the data they handle. This is particularly true for hospital management systems. One of the critical issues I had to address was concurrency. While the Node.js and Express.js backend could manage concurrency without a hitch, the SQL tables required manual number incrementation. As there was no dedicated database team, I had to research the type of transaction to ensure concurrency. I managed to lock individual columns and update them during a millisecond lag, a trade-off that was preferable to presenting the user with an error.</li>
</ol>
<p>Developing an ERP application is a complex and demanding task, but the lessons learned from confronting and overcoming these challenges have been invaluable. It requires not just technical prowess, but also a deep understanding of the user's needs and the ability to adapt and evolve over time.</p>
