<h1>Is Entrepreneurship for Everyone?</h1>
<p>
    The buzz around startups and software development has been unrelenting, giving the impression that we are constantly at the precipice of a new tech boom. The remarkable things people are achieving with software certainly inspire awe. But the question is, should every software engineer consider building a company? It might seem like an appealing idea, but it's not always the right path for everyone. Speaking from my experience as an engineer, I initially misjudged the intricacies of entrepreneurship.

    I once envisioned solving the problems of farmers, but I soon realized that I lacked the funds and the knowledge to pitch a viable business model to venture capitalists. So, I decided to make money first and then assist farmers with better equipment and crop recommendation software. I chose the e-commerce sector, specifically focusing on Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG). However, it didn't take long for me to realize that this sector had extremely thin margins, a fact that only dawned upon me after I had already implemented the software.

    In the face of these challenges, I quit and started working in a startup. This ground-level work experience was immensely beneficial. I got to meet clients, solve problems at the ground level, and make things happen. The joy I derived from problem-solving was far more satisfying than starting a company. It was then that I understood my passion truly lies in solving problems. Since that realization, I've been diligently working as a software engineer, continuing my journey of problem-solving.
