<h1>Are Newsletters Still Relevant?</h1>
<p>
    Newsletters have been a vital communication tool since humans first learned to write. With the advent of emails, digital newsletters have taken center stage. They are commonly used for marketing, knowledge-sharing, or updating clients on important topics such as changes in terms and conditions.

    In the age of social media, YouTube, and blogs, newsletters may seem old-fashioned or even naive at first glance. However, as time has passed, I've realized that not everything is readily available or easily discoverable through search engines. Sometimes, certain valuable insights may not be visible on social media or might be too time-consuming for a busy professional to find amidst the daily barrage of information. While social media can provide instantaneous updates, it can also be an addictive distraction that diverts attention from the actual topic of interest.

    In order to stay updated without wasting too much time, I've found that newsletters are an excellent resource. They allow you to keep up with trends and changes in the software world, without spending more than half an hour each day.

    Here are some newsletters that I subscribe to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://tldr.tech/">TLDR Tech</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.angulartraining.com/daily-newsletter/">Angular Training</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://reactdigest.net/">React Digest</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.mongodb.com/newsletter">MongoDB Newsletter</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.mysql.com/news-and-events/newsletter/">MySQL Newsletter</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://nodeweekly.com/">Node Weekly</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
    Subscribing to newsletters might be my personal preference, but I encourage you to try some of the best newsletters out there. You might discover high-quality blogs and articles that aren't easily found through a standard Google search.
