    <h1>How Is the Developer Role Going to Change with AI?</h1>
    <p><time datetime="2023-05-12">2023-05-12</time></p>
    <p>There have been significant advancements in AI. The progress that AI makes is incredible, and the time it takes to adapt to new technology is reducing with each new advancement. If we look back in time, we see that after the discovery of metal, industrialization changed the human race, followed by electrification and the internet. Each new technology had a multi-fold effect compared to the previous breakthrough. Therefore, we can expect AI to touch all fields that require mental effort, analytical thinking, creativity, decision-making, and problem-solving skills first, which is counterintuitive. </p>
  
    <p>It might seem that repetitive physical labor is the first thing to be replaced by AI, and while there has already been considerable progress with machines, AI is not quite there yet because coordinating with physical processes is complex. But, so are creativity, critical thinking, and calculation. These are the aspects that are going to be replaced first since they are relatively easy to replicate with trained mathematical models. </p>
  
    <p>However, the adoption of technology is never a direct hit. It first enters our lives as a tool, and then gradually replaces the person doing the job. But with AI, the timeline between assisting a person and replacing them is going to shrink. Additionally, the number of people needed to use the tool is going to decrease dramatically. </p>
  
    <p>As a developer, In the past, to solve a problem, we needed to go to a library, read books, index them, and then implement our solution. Then came Google and Stack Overflow. I've met experienced programmers who've said that tasks have become much easier; we used to refer to books to solve things, all you do is Google and solve things. This is not the real pain. </p>
  
    <p>There will always be critics of new technology, but AI is here to stay. It will change our lives to an extent that might be hard to imagine at this point. We're moving towards a future where anything done with the brain can be replaced. But how much are we going to trust it? How secure is the company's data or personal data? These issues will be solved in no time, but everyone will have to bet on their own role when they start using AI. Eventually, it will learn to do a better job as you keep training it. </p>
  
    <p>As for me, I can see that I'm able to solve many problems in far less time than I used to spend reading multiple blogs, checking Stack Overflow, etc. I'm concentrating on the vision which is important to build a product and make it happen.</p>
