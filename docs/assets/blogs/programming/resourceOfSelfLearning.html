<h1>Journey of a Self-Taught Developer</h1>
    <p>In my life, self-learning has played a crucial role. A lesson instilled in me during my school days - "never stop learning" - has had a profound impact. The free resources available on the internet, like Wikipedia, blogs, and YouTube channels, have been pivotal in my journey.</p>

    <p>My passion for computers traces back to my childhood, but my exposure was limited due to scarce resources. I had little knowledge of the potential software held, the key element that truly brings computers to life. Most of my early exposure to technology came through my brother, who owned a computer shop.</p>

<p>After navigating through science studies in high school, I had lost confidence in my academic capabilities. So, I chose what I thought was the easiest subject: automobiles. However, fate took a turn, and I landed a position at Accenture through campus placements. I worked there for 2.5 years, during which I received two 'Best Performer of the Project' awards.</p>

<p>Driven by a desire for bigger achievements, I resigned from my job, albeit without a clear plan. Over time, I learnt various technologies needed to launch web and mobile apps, including Flutter, JavaScript, MySQL, and MongoDB.</p>

<p>In the beginning, I was lost in the confusion of JavaScript framework wars and language wars. I studied C++ and C, thinking it would help me build the fastest and cheapest applications. But I was wrong. These wars do not lead to productive outcomes; they only foster software politics.</p>

<p>One significant revelation during my journey was the importance of Open Source Software (OSS). It's one of the best things to have happened in the 21st-century software industry. Today, many corporations and software giants are built on open source, and even a single developer can create impressive software from their own corner of the world.</p>

<p>However, it's not just about software; it's about understanding client needs and their requirements. Along the way, I discovered some invaluable YouTube channels that helped shape my mindset for software development:</p>

</ol>

<p>In conclusion, don't fall into the trap of language and framework wars. Start building with the technology you are comfortable with, and remember that it can always be changed later when you need to scale. Clients don't care about the technology you choose; they care about whether it works or not.</p>
